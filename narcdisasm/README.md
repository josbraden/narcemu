# narcdisasm

A disassembler for NARC

Not a very *good* disassebler, seeing as how it doesn't translate binary into assembly language.

Instead it spits out an instruction breakdown.  Mostly useful for testing.

This code was originally COSC 3327 Homework 2, ported here for testing.

Program reads a 16-bit number from binary and displays it with some stuff.
